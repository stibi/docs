# Test 02 - more pull lambda tests

## Hello

The lambda function is now updated a lot, so let's test it by pushing a commit directly to the master branch of my vp
docs repo fork.

## PR test

Direct push to the master works, now to test merging a pull request...

## So far so good

another direct git push to the master...

## And to make sure, another PR merge test

Git push working, now finally verify the PR merge event and we can call it a day.
