* ✓ <del>New GUI stack (JS + REST API)</del> *(shipped in 2.0)*
* Improved user interface *(ongoing effort; major usability improvements shipped in 3.0)*
* **Improved support for complex 3<sup>rd</sup> party plugins** *(this one is really important now, will be focus of 4.0)*
* Update mechanism *(initial support in 3.0, more to come)*
* Multisite support *(quite hard to do, contributors welcome :) )*
* Localization
* Support for large sites *(many improvements done in 2.0, some more might come in the future but it's not a priority at the moment)*
