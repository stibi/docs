## Release overview ##

Our alpha users on Mac OS reported a bug in DesktopServer, a popular MAMP stack, that this release fixes. It adds very little on top of that. 

Highlights of the release are:

* **DesktopServer on Mac OS and other popular MAMP stacks supported**. There is a bug in some of the favorite development stacks built on XAMPP on Mac OS. We added a workaround that allows VersionPress to run on such stacks until they fix the bug themselves. 
* **Table prefix other than wp_ supported**. Our code was prepared for custom prefixes from the beginning but we forgot one instance in 1.0-alpha1 where the `wp_` was hardcoded.
* **Other small fixes and improvements**, e.g. an update to the alpha warning in the header (does not use problematic WP thickbox any more but rather a Bootstrap-like popover). Nothing major.


## Usage notes ##

System requirements for this release are:

* PHP 5.3 or later
* WordPress 3.8 or later
* **Clean installation of WordPress**  (you can then try to install some simpler 3rd party plugins but this whole area is quite volatile at the moment)
* Git 1.9 or later (earlier versions might work but are not tested)
* `proc_open()` enabled


## Known issues ##

Same as in [1.0-alpha1](./1.0-alpha1) apart from the fixes described above.
