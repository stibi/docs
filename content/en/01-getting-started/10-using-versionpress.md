# Using VersionPress #

VersionPress is used in three main ways:


## Auto-tracking (unattended mode)

You can activate VersionPress and forget it. It will work behind the scenes, automatically tracking changes on the site. Learn more in the [change tracking](../feature-focus/change-tracking) topic. 


## Inspecting history of changes

On the VersionPress admin screen, you can inspect the history of changes:

<figure style="width: 90%;">
  <img src="../../media/history-overview.png" alt="History overview" /> 
</figure>

Each row is clickable and will reveal more details about the change:

<figure style="width: 90%;">
  <img src="../../media/expand-row-to-show-detail.png" alt="Change detail" /> 
</figure>

You can also switch to the *Full diff* mode which displays complete contents of the change:

<figure style="width: 90%;">
  <img src="../../media/full-diff-view.png" alt="Full diff view" /> 
</figure>

## Undoing changes

When something goes wrong, you can use the [Undo and Rollback feature](../feature-focus/undo-and-rollback) to return to a previous state of a site or to revert a specific change.
